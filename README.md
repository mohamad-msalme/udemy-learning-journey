# Udemy Learning Journey

This repository tracks the Udemy courses I'm taking and contains the code examples and project files I'm creating. It serves as a learning resource for myself and others interested in various topics in software development.

Each course has its own folder with notes, code examples, and project files. Check out the individual course folders for more details and resources.
