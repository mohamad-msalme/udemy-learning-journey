# React and TypeScript: Build a Portfolio Project

This repository contains all the coding exercises and projects completed by me during the [React and TypeScript: Build a Portfolio Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/) course on Udemy. 

## Course Description

In this course, I built a portfolio website using React, TypeScript, and Firebase. Throughout the course, I learned how to use React to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, how to integrate TypeScript into a React project, and how to use Firebase to handle authentication and data storage.

## Project Description

The project in this course is a portfolio website that showcases my work as a developer. It includes a home page with an introduction to me and my work, a projects page where I can add and display my past and current projects, and a contact page with a contact form that visitors can use to send me a message. Additionally, there is an admin page where I can manage the projects and messages submitted through the contact form. The website is built using React and TypeScript and uses Firebase for authentication and data storage.
